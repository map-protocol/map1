# Conduct

Small project. Narrow mission. Deterministic identity for structured data.

Contributions and discussion welcome. Drama is not. Be professional, disagree on the merits, dont make it personal. If you've spent any time on a security team you already know how this works.

Maintainers will remove anyone making the project worse for everyone else. Report problems to map1protocol@gmail.com.

Thats the whole policy.
